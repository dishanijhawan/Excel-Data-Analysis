GDP(Gross Domestic Product)
Before you delve into it, let’s have a basic understanding of GDP.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the
finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific period,
usually one financial year.
- GDP provides a scorecard for a country’s Economic Health.
- GDP can be calculated in 3 ways using Expenditure, Production or income.
- The GDP ratio to the region's total population is the per capita GDP, and the
same is called the Mean Standard of Living.
More on GDP
It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard of living in a
nation. When comparing the GDP of different nations for this purpose, these two
must be as follows:-
1. GDP of all countries should be in the same currency.
2. GDP of two countries will be dependent on the population as well, so it is always
good to compare them with respect to GDP per capita which is GDP/ population.
There can exist multiple factors that affect a country's GDP in both good and bad
ways; let's look into some common factors like industries production, population,
pollution, Government policies, etc. There are a few factors that will be different as
per the population. Whenever these features i.e, Energy consumption, CO2
emission and Tourism Outbound are compared between two countries they
always get calculated in terms of per population (per capita).
